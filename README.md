# Autodesk Inventor Thread Modeler

## Description

The Thread Modeler tool has been developed to allow Autodesk Inventor users to generate a realistic modeled equivalent thread based on an existing Inventor thread feature. 

Users are able to select an existing thread feature in the model, which the Thread Modeler then converts to a realistic 3D modeled thread based on the underlying thread feature properties.

Modeled threads are generated saving a lot of time and effort for the user when compared with a manual approach, bringing a higher degree of realism to your models.

Unfortunately the plugin from the autodesk [store](https://apps.autodesk.com/INVNTOR/en/Detail/Index?id=2540506896683021779&appLang=en&os=Win64) was depreciated around 2023 and no longer works for Inventor versions above 2020.

## Install

Copy the `ThreadModeler.bundle` plugin folder to your Autodesk Application Plugin folder.
